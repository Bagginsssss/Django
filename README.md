# Django

Some fun Django projects

The projects will be a mixture of my learning.

As of 1/11/2023 i have a few builds in mind to continue with and have recently discovered Python / Django Backend and React.js frontend.

I'm working my way through several courses along with my own work and Leetcode questions / Roadmaps

Thanks :)
